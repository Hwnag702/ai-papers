# Guide Anchoring

https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.03278

For RPN based models, learn how to generate anchors instead of using the basic sliding window approach. 

Has a cost to training time and a cost to RPN inference time, but improves accuracy and may improve inference time when the model has a heavy head (possibly Mask RCNN)
